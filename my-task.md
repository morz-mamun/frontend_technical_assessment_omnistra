As part of process, i'd like you to complete a UI implementation task to evaluate: 

- Pixel-level UI accuracy 
- Interaction fidelity 
- Responsiveness 
- Code quality & structure 
- Attention to detail 
## **Task overview** 
You are **required to replicate** the following two sections **exactly** as they appear on the original (reference) websites. 
### **Navbar section** 
Reference:[ https://www.chargeflow.io/](https://www.chargeflow.io/) Recreate the **navigation bar** with: 

- Identical layout and spacing 
- Typography, colors, and sizing 
- Hover states 
- Dropdown behavior 
- Scroll behavior (sticky, transparent-to-solid transitions etc.) 
- Animations and transitions 
- Responsive behavior (desktop, tablet, mobile) ![ref1]
### **Integrations section** 
Reference:[ https://domu.ai/](https://domu.ai/) 

Recreate the **Integrations section** with: 

- Identical layout and grid structure 
- Spacing and alignment 
- Typography 
- Hover states 
- Animations and transitions 
- Scroll effects 
- Responsive behavior across breakpoints 
## **Requirements** 
### **Pixel accuracy** 
The implementation should visually match the reference as closely as possible. We will compare: 

- Layout precision 
- Spacing consistency 
- Transition timing 
- Responsive behavior 
- Interaction fidelity 
### **Code quality** 
We will review: 

- Folder structure 
- Component architecture 
- Reusability 
- Clean code practices 
- Naming conventions 
- Performance considerations 
- Responsiveness strategy ![ref1]
## **Submission guidelines** 
I have to submit: 

1. A public GitHub repository link 
1. Clear setup instructions in the README 
1. Run instructions (local dev command + build command) 
1. Screenshots (optional but recommended) 
1. Any assumptions made during implementation
